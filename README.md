#Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer Assessments

This project is the Peer Assessment project of the "Getting & Cleaning Data" course which is part of the "Datascience" specialization provided by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Coursera.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project can be seen as a preliminatory data preparation phase in order to adress a question. The question and the analysis is not part of this work. In this project, we focus on how we are organising the data to address the question.

##Prerequisite
We assume that
* data files have been downloaded from the [Coursera web site](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extracted to a directory named "data" in the working directory
* packages "reshape" and "reshape2" are available (if not, please install thoses packages first)

##Runnning script
The script run_analysis.R can be executed with the following command
```R
source('run_analysis.R')
```

##Codebook
This repository also contains a [codebook](https://github.com/benoitdechateauvieux/coursera-gcd/blob/master/CodeBook.md) that gives
* Information about the variables
* Description of how the data was collected
* Information about the experimental study design
